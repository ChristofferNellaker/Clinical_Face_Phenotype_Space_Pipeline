#  How to use code v1.2
#
------------
Installation of source code.
------------
Download the code from https://github.com/ChristofferNellaker/Clinical_Face_Phenotype_Space_Pipeline
Place in desired folder.
Install dependencies (list below)
Configure pipeline.ini with relative paths to models and dependencies.
Configure image_folders.ini to point to folders with images to be analysed.
Configure path_to_meta_data_parser.py 

Alternatively, there is an Ubuntu Virtual Box VM with a functioning compiled
pipeline available throught the vagrand cloud  chrisn/CFPS_VM

--------------------------------------------------
Running the Clinical Face Phenotype Space pipeline.
--------------------------------------------------
Check the pipeline printout
cmd> python ./Clinical_Face_Phenotype_Space.py -vvvvn 

Run the pipeline
cmd> python ./Clinical_Face_Phenotype_Space.py -vvvv

Results will be output into:
./output_Diag_P0P1_acc.tab
./output_CIF_acc.tab

--------------------------------------------------
Some notes on design principles applied
--------------------------------------------------
. The MATLAB scripts are compiled as the first step of the pipeline which allows them to be run in parallel.
. The variables for each script are passed in simple text files managed by the python ruffus pipeline. 
. Matlab output is stored in the sqlite3 database. The functions serialize and deserialise are used to encode these.
